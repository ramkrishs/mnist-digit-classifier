# MNIST-Digit-Classifier

A Jupyter Notebook project for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras in Python.

## Project Overview

The MNIST-Digit-Classifier notebook demonstrates the basics of image classification with neural networks in an interactive format. This project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The notebook guides you through building and training a neural network model to predict the digit in each image.

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter Notebook environment for hands-on learning.
- Utilizes TensorFlow 2.x and Keras for model building and training.
- Implements a Sequential model with dense layers for classification.
- Includes data preprocessing steps such as normalization and reshaping.
- Demonstrates one-hot encoding for categorical label representation.
- Provides visualizations of training images and predictions for model evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the notebook:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter or JupyterLab

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramkrishs/mnist-digit-classifier.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd MNIST-Digit-Classifier
```

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies, including Jupyter:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

Navigate to the `mnist_digit_classifier.ipynb` notebook and open it. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the cells and execute the code.
